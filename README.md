### LICENSE:
For this project I've used a CC-BY-SA 4.0 license. For more information, please view the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.

### THINGS TO NOTE:
I've only tested this on a Windows 10 Pro 64-bit ssytem. This should mostly work on linux, but you might have to make your own version of the included batch files.


### SETUP:
First, you will need a bot token. To obtain this, you will need to create a bot account. Head over to the 
[Discord new app tool](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create) and create a profile to obtain a bot token.
Then, navigate to the bottom of [Discordbot.py](Discordbot.py) and put your bot token where the text 'Put your bot token here' is. 
**PLEASE NOTE** keep the quotes around your bot token.


### ADDING NEW COMMANDS:
If you would like to add a new command, please create a branch and label it with the name of your command. Before any new commands are pushed to master, they will undergo at least five hours of testing by me.
