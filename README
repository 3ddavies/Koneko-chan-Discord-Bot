ADDING NEW COMMANDS:

If you would like to add a new command, please create a branch and label it with the name of your command. Before any new commands are pushed to master, they will undergo at least five hours of testing by me.

SETUP:

First, you will need a bot token. To obtain this, you will need to create a bot account. Head over to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me/create and create a profile to obtain a bot token.
Then, navigate to the bottom of Discordbot.py and put your bot token where the text is.

If you have any questions you can contact me at gabe.peressini@gmail.com or on discord: Jupiter and Mars#9960
