Allows an admin to post a message as if it were the bot. After issuing the command, if you have to correct permissions, you will
get a message saying "Awaiting instruction". If you now switch to the command prompt, you will see 'Say: ' you can now type whatever
you wish and upon pressing enter it will be posted from the bot's account. PLEASE NOTE: The bot cannot process other commands while
in this mode so once you have finished typing, type ```/halt/``` in the command prompt to put allow Koneko to continue processing
