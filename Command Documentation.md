## Koneko:

### Utility/Debug:

#### anako:
Usage: ```!anako```

Allows an admin to post a message as if it were [Koneko](#koneko-1). After issuing the command, if you have to correct permissions, you will get a message saying "Awaiting instruction". If you now switch to the command prompt, you will see 'Say: ' you can now type whatever you wish and upon pressing enter it will be posted from the bot's account. PLEASE NOTE: The bot cannot process other commands while in this mode so once you have finished typing, type ```/halt/``` in the command prompt to put allow [Koneko](#koneko-1) to continue processing commands.

#### arclog:

Archives the log.

#### gab:
Usage: ```!gab```

Restarts both [Koneko](#koneko-1) and [Kuroka](#kuroka)

#### setchan:

#### gif:

This was a proof of concept that GIF images could be uploaded via [Koneko](#koneko-1). Posts [this gif](dancingmiku2.gif) in chat.

#### image:
Usage: ```!image x Tags, tags, tags, etc.```

Grabs x images from Danbooru with specified tags where x is the number of images to grab and posts them in chat. You will first need to use the [setchan](#setchan) command in the channel you are trying to post images in before [Koneko](#koneko-1) will post images to it. Example: ```!image 5 hero``` will return 5 images with the tag 'hero'. You can have as many tags as you like but there is a limit of 100 images per request so if you need more just issue the command multiple times.

## Kuroka:

### Utility/Debug:

#### vci:
Usage: ```-vci```

### Other:

#### dice:
Usage: ```-dice x y```

Rolls x dice with y sides and posts [this gif](dice.gif). Example: ```-dice 5 6``` will roll five six-sided dice. The gif is posted first then the result looks somthing like this: 'You rolled 5 d6s. They landed on: \[5, 3, 5, 2, 3\] for a total of 18'


### Music:
The music command is a bit different then the other commands. It has six subcommands, the names of which are below:

#### join:
Usage: ```-music join```
