## Koneko:

### Utility/Debug:

#### anako:
Usage: ```!anako```

Allows an admin to post a message as if it were [Koneko](#koneko-1). After issuing the command, if you have to correct permissions, you will get a message saying "Awaiting instruction". If you now switch to the command prompt, you will see 'Say: ' you can now type whatever you wish and upon pressing enter it will be posted from the bot's account. PLEASE NOTE: The bot cannot process other commands while in this mode so once you have finished typing, type ```/halt/``` in the command prompt to put allow [Koneko](#koneko-1) to continue processing commands.

#### arclog:
Usage: ```!arclog```

Archives the log.

#### gab:
Usage: ```!gab```

Short for 'Get allocated blocks'. Print's the result in chat.

#### getauth:
Usage: ```!getauth```

Short for 'Get author'. This exists as a test for the ```pass_context``` argument. Will print the author of the original message in chat.

#### listtags:
Usage: ```!listtags```

Lists Danbooru tags in chat.

#### logout:
Usage: ```logout```

Logs out [Koneko](#koneko-1).

#### ostimes:
Usage: ```!ostimes```

Prints the ostimes in chat. The result will be something like this:
```nt.times_result(user=3.203125, system=0.40625, children_user=0.0, children_system=0.0, elapsed=0.0)```

#### restart:
Usage: ```!restart```

Restarts both [Koneko](#koneko-1) and [Kuroka](#kuroka)

#### setchan:
Usage: ```!setchan```
Tells [Koneko](#koneko-1) that images can be posted in the channel the command is issued in. NOTE: [image](#image) will not work if this is not done first.

#### ss:
Usage: ```!ss args```

Sets the ingame status of [Koneko](#koneko-1). Example: ```!ss with fire``` will set [Koneko](#koneko)'s ingame status to 'playing with fire'


#### stsca:
Usage: ```!stsca arg```

Sets the escape argument for [anako](#anako). Example: ```!stsca /1234/``` sets the escape argument to ```/1234/```

#### time:
Usage: ```!time```

Prints the date and time in chat. the result will look somthing like this: 'The time is 11:43:27 and the date is 5/5/2018'

#### vomit:

Dumps the entire log into chat. This was created as a proof of concept. I recommend you never use this.


### File Exploring:

#### cd:
Usage: ```!cd```

Changes the [pwd](#pwd)

#### ls:
Usage: ```!ls```

Lists the contents of the [pwd](#pwd)

#### pwd:
Usage: ```!pwd```

### Other:

#### credits:
Usage: ```!credits```
Prints 'Programmed by Gabe @Jupiter and Mars' in chat.

#### gif:
Usage: ```!gif```
This was a proof of concept that GIF images could be uploaded via [Koneko](#koneko-1). Posts [this gif](dancingmiku2.gif) in chat.

#### image:
Usage: ```!image x Tags, tags, tags, etc.```

Grabs x images from Danbooru with specified tags where x is the number of images to grab and posts them in chat. You will first need to use the [setchan](#setchan) command in the channel you are trying to post images in before [Koneko](#koneko-1) will post images to it. Example: ```!image 5 hero``` will return 5 images with the tag 'hero'. You can have as many tags as you like but there is a limit of 100 images per request so if you need more just issue the command multiple times.

#### ping:
Usage: ```!ping```

Prints 'üèì Pong!' in chat.

#### ppap:
Usage: ```!ppap```

Prints 'Just for you, Gil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E00Zuayv9Q' in chat.

#### stats:

### Deprecated:

#### climsg:
Usage: ```!climsg```

An older and lesser version of [anako](#anako).

#### imgdan:
Usage: ```!imgdan```

This and [imggel](#imggel) are both primitive precursors to [image](#image). How this command works is it generates a random interger from 1 to 3000000 and appends it to 'http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/'.

#### imggel:
Usage: ```!imggel```

This and [imgdan](#imgdan) are both primitive precursors to [image](#image). How this command works is it generates a random interger from 1 to 4079175 and appends it to 'https://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=post&s=view&id='.

#### omgmt:
Usage: ```!omgmt```

Stands for once more get message test. Omgmt is a test in getting the id of a message [Koneko](#koneko-1) sent and then deleting her own message.
